# Sand
Trying to implement Sand. 
A particle drawing game, where you can draw particles of different colors and sizes and let the gravity work its action. 
You can stop the time to draw, and then restart it, to see your drawing in action. 
You can make fixed particles as well, that act as boundaries/walls for other particles to land on and interact with.

## Environment
Pygame - Python
